## The practice of basic arithmetic operations in python by performing predefined calculations.

#Assign Values

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Calculations

addition = number1 + number2
substraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2

# The outcome/ Results

print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {addition}")
print(f"Substraction of {number1} and {number2} is {substraction}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {multiplication}")
